This project uses makeshift to build.  If the makeshift directory is empty then
you probably need to run

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Then to get a debug version it should be simply

$ make

and you can run the tests with

$ make test

If it all works you can build the release version with

$ make release

This will build inside a directory called release.
