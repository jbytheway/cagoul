This project uses makeshift to build.  If the makeshift directory is empty then
you probably need to run

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

You will also require the development headers and libraries for Boost and a GL
library.  Building the examples requires GLU and glut also.

Then to get a debug version it should be simply

$ make

and you can run the tests with

$ make test

If it all works you can build the release version with

$ make release

This will build inside a directory called release.

To build the documentation (which will require doxygen and dot) run

$ make doc

at the top level.  This will build HTML docs in doc/html.
