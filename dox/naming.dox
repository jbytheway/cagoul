/** \page naming Naming
Where a Cagoul concept has a direct equivalent in GL, then the same name is
used, retaining the GL CamelCase, but removing any \c gl or \c GL prefix.  For
example, cagoul::Get is a wrapper for glGet, and cagoul::ClearColor for
glClearColor.

Where there is no direct GL equivalent, the C++
\c underscore_separated_lower_case naming convention is used. for example,
cagoul::getter_setter is a class used to support other Cagoul functionality.
