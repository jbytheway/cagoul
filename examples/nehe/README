The examples herein are derived from those on http://nehe.gamedev.net/

The 'raw' directory contains versions close to the Linux versions available on
the site, with minor alterations to remove compiler warnings or normalize
formatting.

The 'cagoul' directory contains versions which have been ported to cagoul.

Thus, these examples demonstrate how to translate common OpenGL constructs into
cagoul.

The examples use GLUT as a windowing library.  Cagoul does not wrap GLUT, so
those portions are preserved.
